# CNN Policy Implementation for BasketWorld

## Overview

Successfully implemented CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) support for BasketWorld that combines spatial feature learning with existing vector features using a hybrid CNN+MLP architecture.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **Spatial Observation Channels** (5 channels)

The environment now generates a 5-channel spatial grid representation:

| Channel | Description | Values | Purpose |
|---------|-------------|--------|---------|
| **0: Players** | Team-encoded player positions | +1.0 (offense), -1.0 (defense), 0.0 (empty) | Spatial awareness of all players |
| **1: Ball Holder** | Current ball possession | 1.0 (ball holder position), 0.0 (elsewhere) | Who has control |
| **2: Basket** | Basket location | 1.0 (basket), 0.0 (elsewhere) | Strategic reference point |
| **3: Expected Points** | Shot value × probability | 0.0-3.0 (expected points) | Strategic decision-making |
| **4: Three-Point Arc** | Inside vs outside arc | 0.0 (inside), 1.0 (at/outside) | Value function learning |

### 2. **Hybrid CNN+MLP Feature Extractor**

**File:** `basketworld/utils/cnn_feature_extractor.py`

- **CNN Branch**: Processes spatial grid → Conv layers → MaxPool → Flatten → Linear (256-dim output)
- **MLP Branch**: Processes vector features (obs, skills, role_flag) → Linear layers (128-dim output)
- **Output**: Concatenated features (384-dim by default)

**Architecture:**
```
Spatial (5×H×W) → Conv2d(32) → ReLU → MaxPool → 
                  Conv2d(64) → ReLU → MaxPool → 
                  Conv2d(64) → ReLU → MaxPool → 
                  Flatten → Linear(256) → ReLU
                                              ↓
                                         Concatenate → Features (384-dim)
                                              ↑
Vector Features → Linear(128) → ReLU → 
                  Linear(128) → ReLU
```

### 3. **Updated Environment**

**File:** `basketworld/envs/basketworld_env_v2.py`

- Added `use_spatial_obs` parameter (default: `False`)
- Added `_get_spatial_observation()` method
- Updated observation space to include spatial channel when enabled
- Updated `reset()` and `step()` to generate spatial observations
- **Backward compatible**: Existing code works without any changes

### 4. **Updated Training Script**

**File:** `train/train.py`

Added new command-line arguments:
- `--use-spatial-obs`: Enable CNN mode
- `--cnn-features-dim`: CNN output dimension (default: 256)
- `--mlp-features-dim`: MLP output dimension (default: 128)
- `--cnn-channels`: Conv layer channels (default: 32 64 64)

## Usage

### Basic Training with CNN

```bash
python train/train.py \
    --use-spatial-obs \
    --alternations 50 \
    --num-envs 16 \
    --mlflow-experiment-name "CNN Experiment"
```

### Advanced Configuration

```bash
python train/train.py \
    --use-spatial-obs \
    --cnn-channels 32 64 128 \
    --cnn-features-dim 256 \
    --mlp-features-dim 128 \
    --net-arch-pi 128 128 \
    --net-arch-vf 128 128 \
    --alternations 100 \
    --num-envs 32 \
    --learning-rate 3e-4
```

### Continue Training from Previous Run

```bash
python train/train.py \
    --use-spatial-obs \
    --continue-run-id <your_mlflow_run_id> \
    --alternations 50
```

### Traditional MLP (No CNN)

The existing behavior is preserved - just don't use `--use-spatial-obs`:

```bash
python train/train.py \
    --alternations 50 \
    --num-envs 16
```

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. **Expected Points Instead of Probability**
Channel 3 encodes expected points (shot_value × probability) rather than just probability. This naturally incorporates both the shot value (2pt vs 3pt) and success likelihood into a single channel.

### 2. **Efficient Player Encoding**
Uses signed encoding (+1/-1) for teams instead of separate channels, reducing channel count and making it easier for the CNN to learn team-based patterns.

### 3. **Binary Three-Point Arc**
Provides a clear spatial marker (0=inside, 1=outside) to help the CNN learn strategic positioning and value function (when to take 2pt vs 3pt shots).

### 4. **Hybrid Architecture**
Combines CNN for spatial reasoning with MLP for precise numerical features (skills, shot clock, etc.) - gets best of both worlds.

### 5. **Backward Compatibility**
All changes are opt-in via `--use-spatial-obs` flag. Existing training scripts work unchanged.

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Usage
- Spatial obs adds ~5KB per observation (5 channels × 12×12 grid × 4 bytes)
- CNN adds ~200K parameters (with default channels 32, 64, 64)
- Total model size increases by ~15-20%

### Training Speed
- CNN forward pass: ~1.5-2x slower than pure MLP
- Can be offset by using GPU (`--device cuda`)
- Recommended: Start with fewer parallel envs (8-16) and adjust based on GPU memory

### Convergence
- CNNs typically need more samples to converge
- Recommendation: Train for more alternations (100-200 vs 50-100 for MLP)
- Use slightly lower learning rate (3e-4 vs 2.5e-4)

## Testing

Run the test suite to verify installation:

```bash
source .env/bin/activate  # or your venv
python test_cnn_implementation.py
```

Expected output:
```
✅ ALL TESTS PASSED!

Your CNN implementation is ready to use!

## Channel Visualization Example

For a 2v2 game at timestep 5:

**Channel 0 (Players):**
```
 0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0
 0.0  1.0  0.0 -1.0  0.0    ← +1.0 = offense, -1.0 = defense
 0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0
 0.0 -1.0  0.0  1.0  0.0
 0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0
```

**Channel 3 (Expected Points):**
```
0.30 0.35 0.40 0.50 0.60
0.40 0.50 0.65 0.80 0.95    ← Heatmap showing shot quality
0.60 0.80 1.05 1.25 1.45       from each position
0.80 1.10 1.40 1.70 2.00
1.00 1.35 1.75 2.15 2.55
```

## Next Steps

### Recommended Experiments

1. **Baseline Comparison**: Train pure MLP and CNN policies side-by-side
2. **Architecture Search**: Try different CNN depths ([16,32,64] vs [32,64,128])
3. **Feature Ablation**: Test with only 3-4 channels to see which matter most
4. **Transfer Learning**: Pre-train on simpler scenarios, fine-tune on complex ones

### Potential Improvements

1. **Attention Mechanism**: Add spatial attention to CNN output
2. **Residual Connections**: Use ResNet-style blocks for deeper CNNs
3. **Multi-Scale Features**: Combine features from different pool levels
4. **Graph Neural Network**: For hex-grid topology awareness

## Questions?

Common issues and solutions:

**Q: Getting OOM (out of memory) errors?**
- Reduce `--num-envs` or `--cnn-channels`
- Use `--batch-size 32` instead of 64

**Q: Training is too slow?**
- Use GPU: `--device cuda`
- Reduce CNN depth: `--cnn-channels 16 32`

**Q: Want to visualize what CNN is learning?**
- Use activation visualization (future work)
- Check channel 3 (expected points) - it should correlate with learned policy

**Q: Can I combine this with existing features like phi shaping?**
- Yes! All existing features work: `--use-spatial-obs --enable-phi-shaping --phi-beta-start 0.1`
