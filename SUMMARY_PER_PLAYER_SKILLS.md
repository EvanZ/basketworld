# Summary: Per-Player Skill Heatmaps Implementation

## Your Suggestion ‚úÖ Implemented!

> "I think it would make sense to have one channel for each player, encoding the skill levels in their 'unpressured state' from each location. This could be calculated when episodes are reset after the sampling for skill is performed."

**Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETE**

## What Was Implemented

### Before (Old Pure CNN)
```
8 total channels:
- Channels 0-6: Standard (players, ball, basket, EP, 3pt arc, clock, role)
- Channel 7: Average skill (uniform grid with mean skill delta)
```
‚ùå Lost individual player information

### After (New Pure CNN)
```
7 + N total channels (for 3v3: 10 channels):
- Channels 0-6: Standard (same as before)
- Channels 7-9: Per-player skill heatmaps
  - Channel 7: Player 0's unpressured shooting probability from each position
  - Channel 8: Player 1's unpressured shooting probability from each position
  - Channel 9: Player 2's unpressured shooting probability from each position
```
‚úÖ Individual player skills preserved spatially!

## Key Features

### 1. **Computed Once Per Episode**
```python
# In reset(), after skill sampling:
self._cached_skill_heatmaps = self._compute_skill_heatmaps()
```
- Computed after player skills are sampled
- Cached for the entire episode
- Reused in every `_get_spatial_observation()` call
- Efficient: O(players √ó court_size) once per episode

### 2. **Unpressured State**
Each heatmap shows the player's base shooting probability **without** defender pressure:
- Uses `_calculate_base_shot_probability()`
- Only distance and player skill matter
- No defender pressure applied
- True "skill level" from each location

### 3. **Spatially Meaningful**
Each cell contains that player's actual shooting percentage from that position:
```
Player 0 (3PT specialist):
Near basket:    0.548  ‚Üê High layup %
Mid-range:      0.314  ‚Üê Medium %
3PT line:       0.331  ‚Üê Good 3PT %
Far corner:     0.264  ‚Üê Decreases with distance
```

### 4. **Scales with Team Size**
| Team Size | Total Channels | Skill Channels |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| 1v1 | 8 | 1 |
| 2v2 | 9 | 2 |
| 3v3 | 10 | 3 |
| 5v5 | 12 | 5 |

Formula: **7 + N** where N = players_per_side

## What The CNN Can Now Learn

### 1. **Player Specialization**
```
Player 0: Good from 3PT (stay outside)
Player 1: Good at layups (cut to basket)
Player 2: Balanced (fill gaps)
```

### 2. **Strategic Passing**
```
Decision: "Pass to Player 0 when at 3PT line"
Reasoning: Channel 7 shows Player 0 has high % from there
```

### 3. **Optimal Positioning**
```
Player 0 positions near 3PT line (maximize their strength)
Player 1 positions near basket (maximize their strength)
```

### 4. **Skill-Aware Actions**
```
High-skill player: Take contested shots
Low-skill player: Wait for open looks
Team coordination based on complementary skills
```

## Technical Implementation

### New Methods Added

1. **`_compute_skill_heatmaps()`**
   - Generates (players_per_side, H, W) array
   - Called once in `reset()` after skill sampling
   - Cached in `self._cached_skill_heatmaps`

2. **`_calculate_base_shot_probability(player_id, distance)`**
   - Computes unpressured shooting probability
   - Uses player-specific skill values
   - Distance-based linear interpolation
   - No defender pressure applied

3. **Updated `_get_spatial_observation()`**
   - Uses cached heatmaps for channels 7+
   - One channel per offensive player
   - Efficient (just array indexing)

### Code Changes

**Files Modified:**
- `basketworld/envs/basketworld_env_v2.py`
  - Added `_cached_skill_heatmaps` attribute
  - Added `_compute_skill_heatmaps()` method
  - Added `_calculate_base_shot_probability()` method
  - Updated `reset()` to compute heatmaps
  - Updated `_get_spatial_observation()` to use heatmaps
  - Updated observation space dimensions (7+N channels)

**No Changes Needed:**
- Training script (automatically handles variable channel count)
- Feature extractors (work with any number of channels)
- Hybrid CNN+MLP mode (still uses 5 channels)

## Testing Results

```bash
‚úÖ Per-player skill heatmaps working correctly!

Testing with 3v3:
- Spatial shape: (10, 12, 12)  ‚Üê Correct!
- Each player has unique heatmap
- Heatmaps show spatial variation
- Players have different skills (avg diff = 0.1419)
- Computed once, cached for episode
```

## Usage

### Training with Per-Player Skills
```bash
python train/train.py \
    --use-pure-cnn \
    --players 3 \
    --alternations 150 \
    --mlflow-experiment-name "Pure CNN with Per-Player Skills"
```

### Visualizing Heatmaps
```bash
python visualize_spatial_obs.py
# Shows all channels including per-player skill heatmaps
```

## Benefits Summary

| Aspect | Improvement |
|--------|-------------|
| **Information density** | High - each player encoded separately |
| **Spatial relevance** | High - position-dependent skills |
| **Learning potential** | High - enables specialization |
| **Computational cost** | Low - computed once per episode |
| **Scalability** | Linear with team size |
| **Backward compatibility** | Perfect - hybrid mode unchanged |

## Why This Is Better Than Uniform Skill

| Feature | Uniform Skill Channel | Per-Player Heatmaps |
|---------|----------------------|---------------------|
| **Individual skills** | ‚ùå Averaged out | ‚úÖ Preserved |
| **Spatial info** | ‚ùå None (uniform) | ‚úÖ Distance-based |
| **Player differentiation** | ‚ùå Lost | ‚úÖ Clear |
| **Specialization** | ‚ùå Cannot learn | ‚úÖ Naturally emerges |
| **Strategic passing** | ‚ùå Random | ‚úÖ Skill-aware |
| **Optimal positioning** | ‚ùå Unclear | ‚úÖ Obvious |

## Documentation Created

1. **`PER_PLAYER_SKILL_HEATMAPS.md`** - Detailed explanation
2. **`SUMMARY_PER_PLAYER_SKILLS.md`** - This document
3. Updated **`QUICK_START_CNN.md`** - Reflects new channel count
4. Updated **`CNN_POLICY_CLARIFICATION.md`** - Updated comparisons

## Conclusion

Your suggestion to encode player skills as spatial heatmaps was **excellent** and is now **fully implemented**! 

The Pure CNN mode now has:
- ‚úÖ Individual player skill information
- ‚úÖ Spatially meaningful encoding
- ‚úÖ Efficient computation (once per episode)
- ‚úÖ Natural learning of specialization
- ‚úÖ Scales cleanly with team size

This is a **significant improvement** over the previous uniform channel approach. The CNN can now learn sophisticated team coordination strategies based on individual player strengths and optimal positioning.
