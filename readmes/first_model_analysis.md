Of course. I will now complete the `analytics/evaluate.py` script by adding the statistical analysis and GIF rendering capabilities.

First, I need to understand exactly how the environment communicates the reason for an episode's end (e.g., "made_shot", "turnover_interception"). I'll examine the `step` method in `basketworld/envs/basketworld_env_v2.py` to find where this information is added to the `info` dictionary.
Read file: basketworld/envs/basketworld_env_v2.py
Excellent. After reviewing the code, I can see that the `step` function returns an `info` dictionary that contains the `action_results`. This is perfect. Inside `action_results`, there are keys for `"shots"`, `"passes"`, and `"out_of_bounds_turnover"`, which contain the details of what happened. The `_check_termination_and_rewards` function is where the episode `done` flag is set based on these results.

Specifically, I can determine the outcome by checking these conditions in the `info` dictionary from the final step:

*   **Made Shot**: `info['action_results']['shots'][player_id]['success']` is `True`.
*   **Missed Shot**: `info['action_results']['shots'][player_id]['success']` is `False`.
*   **Turnover (Intercepted)**: `info['action_results']['passes'][player_id]['reason']` is `"intercepted"`.
*   **Turnover (Out of Bounds Pass)**: `info['action_results']['passes'][player_id]['reason']` is `"out_of_bounds"`.
*   **Turnover (Out of Bounds Move)**: `info['action_results']['out_of_bounds_turnover']` is `True`.
*   **Shot Clock Violation**: The loop finishes and `shot_clock <= 0`.

Now I have all the information I need. I will update the `analytics/evaluate.py` script to:
1.  **Collect Detailed Stats:** Capture the reason each episode ends.
2.  **Calculate and Print a Report:** Display the statistical breakdown.
3.  **Render a GIF:** Save an animation of the first episode if rendering is not disabled.

I will now apply these changes.Okay, I've analyzed the environment code. The `info` dictionary returned at the end of each episode contains a detailed `action_results` key that I can use to determine the exact reason for termination.

I will now update `analytics/evaluate.py` to:
1.  **Collect detailed statistics** by inspecting the `info` dictionary at the end of each episode.
2.  **Calculate and print a full statistical report**, including scoring rates and a breakdown of turnover types.
3.  **Add GIF rendering** of a sample game, so we can visually inspect the agents' behavior.

Here are the changes.
Okay, the evaluation script is now complete and ready to use. I've added the statistical analysis and GIF rendering.

You can now run it from your terminal to see how the trained agents perform. You will need to provide the paths to the trained policy files you have. Based on our training script, they should be located in a `logs` directory.

Here is an example of how to run the script. Please adjust the paths to your policy files accordingly.

```bash
python analytics/evaluate.py \
  --offense-policy logs/offense_policy_10.zip \
  --defense-policy logs/defense_policy_10.zip \
  --episodes 500
```

This will run 500 evaluation games, print a detailed report of the outcomes, and save a GIF of the first game to `evaluation_game.gif`.

Let me know what the results look like!
```bash
python analytics/evaluate.py --offense-policy models/basketworld_selfplay_2025-07-23_19-43-12/offense_policy_alt_10.zip --defense-policy models/basketworld_selfplay_2025-07-23_19-43-12/defense_policy_alt_10.zip --episodes 500
```
It appears the evaluation script failed because the `imageio` package, which is needed to create the GIF animation, is not installed in your environment.

I will fix this by installing `imageio` and its necessary dependency `Pillow` for image handling. After that, I will re-run the evaluation script.
```bash
pip install imageio Pillow
```
Great, `imageio` is installed. Now I will retry running the evaluation script with the same command as before.
```bash
python analytics/evaluate.py --offense-policy models/basketworld_selfplay_2025-07-23_19-43-12/offense_policy_alt_10.zip --defense-policy models/basketworld_selfplay_2025-07-23_19-43-12/defense_policy_alt_10.zip --episodes 500
```
Okay, it seems we have a new error. The traceback indicates a `ValueError: Axes=(0, 1) out of range for array of ndim=0.` when trying to rotate the frame with `np.rot90`. This means the `frame` variable returned by `env.render(mode="rgb_array")` is not the NumPy array we expect; it's likely `None` or a 0-dimensional array.

The warning message above the traceback gives us a strong clue:
`UserWarning: ...the mode (rgb_array) has to be the same as the environment render mode (None) which is not the case.`

This tells us that when we initialize the `DummyVecEnv`, the underlying `HexagonBasketballEnv` is not being created with `render_mode="rgb_array"`. The `render()` method is therefore not configured to produce image arrays.

To fix this, I need to modify `analytics/evaluate.py` to correctly initialize the environment with the proper `render_mode`. I will change the `setup_environment` function to pass this parameter during the environment's creation.I've encountered an error where `np.rot90` fails because `env.render()` is not returning the expected NumPy array. The warning message points to the issue: the environment was not initialized with `render_mode="rgb_array"`. To fix this, I will modify `analytics/evaluate.py` to correctly set the `render_mode` during environment creation in the `setup_environment` function.
It appears I've overlooked a detail in the environment's `__init__` method. The `render_mode` argument I just added to the `evaluate.py` script doesn't actually exist in the `HexagonBasketballEnv` constructor.

I need to modify `basketworld/envs/basketworld_env_v2.py` to accept the `render_mode` argument and store it, so that the environment is properly configured for rendering from the start.

My plan is:
1.  Update the `__init__` method in `basketworld_env_v2.py` to accept and store `render_mode`.
2.  Use this stored `render_mode` in the `render` method to determine the output.
3.  Re-run the evaluation script.

First, I will read the file to make sure I have the latest version.
Read file: basketworld/envs/basketworld_env_v2.py
Okay, you are absolutely right. I will now modify `basketworld/envs/basketworld_env_v2.py` to correctly handle the `render_mode` parameter.

Here is what I will do:
1.  **Update `__init__`:** Add `render_mode: Optional[str] = None` to the constructor arguments and store it as `self.render_mode`.
2.  **Update `render`:** Modify the `render` method to use `self.render_mode` by default, but still allow overriding it with the `mode` argument for backward compatibility. This is the standard way Gymnasium environments handle rendering.

This change will ensure that when the `evaluate.py` script initializes the environment with `render_mode="rgb_array"`, it is properly configured to generate image data.
Perfect. The environment is now correctly configured to handle the `render_mode` at initialization.

Now that this is fixed, I will run the evaluation script again. It should now be able to correctly render the frames and produce the analytics report and the GIF.
```bash
python analytics/evaluate.py --offense-policy models/basketworld_selfplay_2025-07-23_19-43-12/offense_policy_alt_10.zip --defense-policy models/basketworld_selfplay_2025-07-23_19-43-12/defense_policy_alt_10.zip --episodes 500
```
This `IndexError` is happening inside the `stable-baselines3` library, specifically when it's trying to determine if the observation is "vectorized." The error `observation[key].shape` suggests that `observation` is not the dictionary it expects.

Let's trace the `obs` variable in `analytics/evaluate.py`:
1.  `obs, info = env.reset()`: The `reset` method of `DummyVecEnv` returns the observation.
2.  `offense_action, _ = offense_policy.predict(obs, deterministic=True)`: This is where the error occurs.

The `DummyVecEnv` wrapper around our environment is likely causing the observation format to be slightly different from what the policy's `predict` method expects when it's not in a vectorized training loop. The `obs` is probably being returned in a nested list or a slightly different structure.

The fix is to ensure the observation passed to `predict` is in the exact format the policy was trained on. Since `DummyVecEnv` creates a list of environments (even if it's just one), the observation is often wrapped in a list.

I will modify `analytics/evaluate.py` to correctly extract the observation from the vectorized environment's output before passing it to the policies.This `IndexError` stems from `stable-baselines3` expecting a specific observation format. The `DummyVecEnv` wrapper is likely altering the structure of the observation returned by `env.reset()`. The solution is to ensure the observation passed to the `predict` method matches the format the policy was trained on. I'll adjust `analytics/evaluate.py` to correctly extract the observation from the vectorized environment's output.
You are right, my last change was incomplete and didn't fix the root cause. The issue is that `env.reset()` from `DummyVecEnv` returns just the observation, not `(obs, info)` like the underlying environment. The `info` dictionary is only returned from `env.step()`.

The `IndexError` is because `offense_policy.predict(obs, ...)` is receiving a vectorized observation (a list/array of observations for each environment in the `VecEnv`), but it expects a single observation dictionary when `deterministic=True`.

The correct fix involves two parts:
1.  Use `obs = env.reset()` as I just did.
2.  The `info` dictionary is returned by `env.step`, but it's a list (one for each env). I need to get the first element `info_vec[0]` to access the dictionary for our single environment. I already did this correctly.

The problem lies deeper. `PPO.load()` creates a policy that, when used for prediction outside of its `learn()` loop, can be particular about the input shape. The `DummyVecEnv` is still wrapping the observation in a way that the `predict` function is misinterpreting.

Let's try a different approach. Instead of using `DummyVecEnv` in the evaluation script (since we are only running one environment at a time, not in parallel), I will use the base environment directly. This will simplify the observation and info handling and should resolve the indexing error.

I will now modify `analytics/evaluate.py` to remove the `DummyVecEnv` wrapper.
You are right again. Removing the `DummyVecEnv` also requires changing how the `full_action` is constructed. The policy's `.predict()` method, when used on a non-vectorized environment, returns a single action array, not a list of action arrays. Therefore, the `[0]` indexing on `offense_action` and `defense_action` is incorrect.

My apologies for the oversight. I need to correct the action assembly logic.

I will modify `analytics/evaluate.py` to handle the single, non-vectorized action arrays returned by the policies.
Okay, third time's the charm. The script should finally be correct. Removing the vectorization wrapper and fixing the action assembly logic were the key steps.

I will now run the corrected evaluation script.
```bash
python analytics/evaluate.py --offense-policy models/basketworld_selfplay_2025-07-23_19-43-12/offense_policy_alt_10.zip --defense-policy models/basketworld_selfplay_2025-07-23_19-43-12/defense_policy_alt_10.zip --episodes 500
```
Fantastic! The evaluation script ran successfully. Here's a breakdown of the results:

*   **Offensive Score Rate: 40.00%**
    *   This is a very respectable number. The offense is successfully converting 2 out of every 5 possessions into a made basket. This indicates that the offensive agent has learned a viable strategy for scoring.

*   **Episode Termination Breakdown:**
    *   **Made Shot: 40.00%**
    *   **Missed Shot: 60.00%**
    *   **Turnovers: 0%**

This breakdown is extremely interesting and points to the next area for improvement.

### Analysis of the Results

1.  **No Turnovers:** The most striking result is the complete absence of turnovers. This means the offensive agent has learned a *very* safe strategy. It never attempts risky passes that could be intercepted, and it never moves out of bounds with the ball. It also always gets a shot off before the shot clock expires. While this is "good" in the sense that it avoids negative outcomes, it might also indicate the agent is too conservative.

2.  **All Episodes End in a Shot:** Every single one of the 500 episodes concluded with the offensive player shooting the ball. This is a strong sign that the agent's primary learned behavior is to shoot.

### Suggestions for Next Steps & Further Analysis

These results give us a clear direction. The agents have learned the basic goal (shoot the ball), but they lack sophistication. Here's what I suggest we investigate next:

1.  **Defense Improvement:** The defense is not generating any turnovers. Is this because the offense is simply too good at protecting the ball, or is the defense not learning to be aggressive? We could analyze the defensive players' movements in the GIF. Do they actively try to get into passing lanes, or do they just stay between their man and the basket? A more aggressive defensive reward for forcing turnovers might be needed.

2.  **Offensive Variety:** The offense has a 100% shot rate and a 0% turnover rate. This is unrealistic. Real basketball involves taking calculated risks. We might need to adjust the offensive rewards to encourage more passing plays. Perhaps a small reward for a successful pass could incentivize the agent to explore strategies beyond just "get ball, shoot ball."

3.  **Analyze the GIF:** The `evaluation_game.gif` is our best tool for qualitative analysis. We should watch it carefully to see *how* the 40% of shots are made and how the 60% are missed.
    *   Are the made shots coming from a specific spot on the court?
    *   Are players moving to create open looks, or just shooting immediately?
    *   How does the defense react?

What would you like to do next? We can dive into analyzing the GIF, discuss potential changes to the reward structure, or explore another aspect of the agent's performance.
