# one issue i've realized with hexagonal tesselation is that it appears one direction is shorter than the other. The hexagons are taller than they are wide. Is there any way to account for this? It seems movement steps will be slightly unequal, unless I'm not understanding.

You have hit on a fascinating and extremely subtle point about hexagonal grids. Your observation is 100% correct, and your intuition about unequal steps is understandable.

Here is the detailed breakdown:

### 1. You Are Correct: The Visual Dimensions are Unequal

For a standard "pointy-topped" hexagon (where the top and bottom are points), if the distance from the center to any vertex is `size`, then:
*   The **Height** of the hexagon is `2 * size`.
*   The **Width** of the hexagon is `sqrt(3) * size` (which is approximately `1.732 * size`).

So, you are right: **the hexagon is taller than it is wide.**

### 2. The Key Insight: Game Logic vs. Visuals

This is the most important part of the answer. The game's *logic* does not operate on the visual, pixel-based dimensions of the hexagon shape. It operates on the abstract, mathematical grid.

**The magic of a hexagonal grid is that the *center point* of any hexagon is exactly equidistant from the center points of all six of its neighbors.**

Think of it like a game of chess. A bishop moving one square diagonally (`√2` units) covers more physical distance on the board than a rook moving one square cardinally (`1` unit). But in the *rules of chess*, they are both considered "one move." The game logic is based on the grid, not the Euclidean distance.

Our environment works the same way:
*   **Logical Distance:** When a player moves from one hexagon to any of its six neighbors (East, Northeast, Northwest, etc.), the `_hex_distance` is always exactly `1`.
*   **Fairness:** All our game mechanics—shot probability, pass probability, defender distance—are based on this fair and consistent logical grid distance. A player who is 3 hexes away is always 3 hexes away, regardless of the direction.

Therefore, while the hexagons *look* taller than they are wide, a "step" in any of the six directions is **perfectly equal** from the perspective of the game's rules and mechanics.

### 3. Why We Don't "Fix" It

What would happen if we tried to make the visual movement distance equal? We would have to do one of two things:

1.  **Stretch the Hexagons:** We could squash the hexagons vertically until their height and width were the same. This would make them non-regular hexagons. The visual movement distance would be more uniform, but the center-to-center distances would become unequal, breaking the beautiful symmetry and simple math that makes the hex grid so powerful in the first place.
2.  **Change the Grid:** We could use a different kind of grid, but then we'd lose the unique properties of hexagons (like having six equidistant neighbors).

The standard, regular hexagon is the accepted best practice because it provides the most elegant and mathematically sound foundation for gameplay, even with the slight visual discrepancy in its dimensions.

### Conclusion

Your observation is astute and correct from a visual standpoint. However, the game's internal logic is built on the mathematically perfect symmetry of the grid's center points, not the visual dimensions of the tiles. This ensures that every "step" a player takes is equal, and all game mechanics are fair and balanced. You have not misunderstood anything; you have simply identified one of the interesting and non-obvious trade-offs of using a hexagonal grid.
